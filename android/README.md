To configure server-address for the Android-Client you should go to file
**__Sensors.Edu/android/app/src/main/java/com/gromyk/sensorsedu/ServerData.java__**

and change IP_ADDRESS variable to desired string.
By default server and client work on the port 3000, to change it go to the same file and change there PORT variable to appropriate for you.
